Jinbe – Helmsman, Knight of the Sea
Jinbe is the calm and honorable helmsman of the Straw Hats, a former Warlord of the Sea and master of Fish-Man Karate. His fighting style uses water manipulation and raw physical strength to overwhelm opponents, whether on land or underwater. Jinbe’s wisdom and experience make him the crew’s voice of reason, and his loyalty to Luffy stems from deep respect for the captain’s ideals. Fun fact: Jinbe can steer the Thousand Sunny through even the most treacherous currents with precision unmatched by any sailor. His dream is tied to Luffy’s—helping create a world where humans and fish-men live in harmony.
