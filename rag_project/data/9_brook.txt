Brook – Musician, Soul King of the Seas
Brook is the gentlemanly skeleton musician of the crew, brought back to life by the Yomi Yomi no Mi after his death. Tall and lanky, with an afro that survived death itself, Brook fights using a rapier and music-based techniques, mixing swordsmanship with his unique ability to leave his soul and move independently from his body. His ice-based attacks, learned after the time skip, allow him to freeze opponents with the chill of the underworld. Fun fact: Brook’s lighthearted requests to see ladies’ underwear are as much comic relief as they are remnants of his goofy personality before death. His dream is to reunite with Laboon, the whale he promised to see again decades ago.
