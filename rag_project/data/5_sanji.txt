Black Leg Style: A uniquely lethal, foot-focused martial art developed so his hands remain safe for cooking.
Sky Walk & Blue Walk: Gravity-defying moves granting aerial and aquatic agility derived from Geppo.
Diable Jambe & Ifrit Jambe: Key power-boosting leg ignitions; the latter manifests blue-white flames linked to his genetic modifications.
Signature moves: A richly named arsenal of flame-infused kicks, each unique in flair and effect—ranging from Concassé (KO’d Luffy) to Hell Memories and the fiery Ifrit Jambe: Bœuf Burst.
